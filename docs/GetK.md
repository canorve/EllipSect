## GetK.pl

Perl script that gives the K constant for a
determined Sersic index. The one that allows the surface
brightness (Ie) to be at the half of the light radius (Re).
See Sersic equation.

To run the code just type in the command line:
```
 ./usage: ./GetK.pl [SersicIndex]
```
Where SersicIndex is (obviously) the Sersic index.
